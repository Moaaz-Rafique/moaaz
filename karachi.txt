GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT (GDD SECTION)
Title: Daily Life Loop – Metropolitan City Sandbox
1.0 OVERVIEW

This document defines the daily gameplay loop, time structure, and activity flow for a 2D lifestyle simulation game set in a dense metropolitan city similar to Karachi.

player planning and decision-making

optional friend and group interactions

energy, hunger, and mood management
